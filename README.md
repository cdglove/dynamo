dynamo
======

Mini expression based language with four primary design goals;
 - Simple: We want non-programers to be able to write expressions
 - Small: We want a small footprint without dragging in a buch of other dependencies
 - C++ integration:  We want to be easily able to call in and out of C++ with limited performance overhead of that
 - Optimizatable: Potentially, we want to bake out C++ code instead of the dynamic expressions
